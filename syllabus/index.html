			<h1>Grading Info</h1>
			
			<h2>Grading</h2>
			<p>Grades are reported at midterm and at the end of the semester.  A midterm grade will give you an indication of
your performance in the course for the first half of the semester but will not become part of your permanent record.  Your final semester grade will become part of your permanent record.</p>

			<p>USF uses an expanded grade point system.  In addition to the 4.0 for an A, 3.0 for a B, 2.0 for a C, and 1.0 for a D, for example, an A- translates as 3.7 quality grade points, and a C+ as 2.3 quality grade points.</p>

			<p>Total points will be computed as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Attendance: 140 Points (14 @ 10 points each)</li>
				<li>Quizzes: 130 Points (13 @ 10 points each)</li>
				<li>Assignments: 240 Points (12 @ 20 points each)</li>
				<li>Final Project: 300 Points</li>
				<li>Total: 810 Points</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Student Evaluation</h2>
			<p>Projects will be graded on the basis of: application of design concepts or, in other words, your grasp of the subject matter, evidence of fulfilling the problem objectives in an appropriate fashion, creativity and the quality of your design, effort, attention to detail, punctuality. Projects must be present before critiques to receive full credit.</p>
